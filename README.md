- Class design with abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition
- Interface implementation
- SQLite database integration using ADO.NET
- CRUD operations and database schema design
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Writing structured documentation

## Language Used
- **C#**: For application logic and class implementation
- **SQL (SQLite)**: For persistent data storage

## Development Process Used
